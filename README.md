# graph-gui
An (in progress) [interactive graph interface](https://skarukas.github.io/graph-gui/index.html) using the HTML canvas element. 

Currently only displays data wrapped in randomly-generated vertices; the edges should come soon too.

Drag vertices to change their position, and command-drag to connect two vertices.

Only tested on Mac (Safari/Chrome) at the moment.
