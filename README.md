# graph-gui
An (in progress) [interactive graph interface](https://skarukas.github.io/graph-gui/index.html) using the HTML canvas element. 

Displays data stored in edges and vertices of an undirected graph. The demo displays points and their Euclidian distances.

Drag vertices to change their position, and command-drag to connect two vertices. Adding/removing vertices and removing edges will be possible soon.
